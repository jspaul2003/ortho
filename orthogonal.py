Helper function for tm_optimization. 

This function removes sequences from the library that have off-target melting temperatures 
above the threshold min(tm_on) - delta. When given a pair of sequences with a higher than

higher total off-target score across the entire tm_off matrix. (If scores are equal, 
there is a 50% chance of removing either sequence).

'''
Melting temperature optimization. Removes sequences from library that have strong 
off-target interactions with other sequences. ie such that all sequences returned 
satisfy the condition max(tm_off) - min(tm_on) <= delta.

At a high level, we iteratively check if removing the worst on-target sequence improves 
the number of sequences that satisfy the delta constraint, as compared to just removing 
the off-target sequences which fail the delta constraint. We pick the greedy strategy 
(remove off-targets or worst on-target) that lets us keep the most amount of sequences 
iteratively. 

We stop once the constraint is wholly satisfied.
