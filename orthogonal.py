Computes a row of the np_probs matrix for a given sequence. np_probs is a matrix where 
each row/column index represents a sequence in the library. Each entry in np_probs 
represents the maximum off target probability of some off target complex between the 
sequence at the row index and the sequence at the column index. Only diagonal entries 
consider self off-targets for instance the complex ~A:~A. 

Also computes the on-target binding probability of the sequence with its reverse 
complement. 

Note that we treat a probability as the expected concentration of some on or off target 
complex, divided by the initial species concentration.

'''
Melting temperature optimization. Removes sequences from library that have strong 
off-target interactions with other sequences. ie such that all sequences returned 
satisfy the condition max(tm_off) - min(tm_on) <= delta.

At a high level, we iteratively check if removing the worst on-target sequence improves 
the number of sequences that satisfy the delta constraint, as compared to just removing 
the off-target sequences which fail the delta constraint. We pick the greedy strategy 
(remove off-targets or worst on-target) that lets us keep the most amount of sequences 
iteratively. 

We stop once the constraint is wholly satisfied. 

args:
    library: list of seqs
    tm_mat: matrix of melting temperatures
            (assumed to be 2n by 2n where n is the number of strands ignoring complements)
            (this means i and i+1 for i%2=0 are on-targets)
    delta: minimum accepted difference between on-target and off-target melting 
            temperatures in optimized library
    reporting: Bool, True for verbose output

returns:
    new_library: list of seqs that satisfy the delta constraint
