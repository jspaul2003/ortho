# Orthogonal DNA Library generator

This repository consists of 4 main files. 

1. orthogonal.py defines all general functions used. 
2. duplex_generator.py acts as a template for a script to generate a duplex orthogonal library. 
3. single_strand_generator.py acts as a template for a script to generate a single stranded orthogonal library. 
4. interactive.py acts as a barebone interactive python terminal line program to generate orthogonal libraries. 

The attached pdf ortho.pdf describes the methods used in generating a duplex library.
